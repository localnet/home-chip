# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Version 1.0

## Purpose

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") defines the terms under which
Contributions are made to the HomeChip project ("Project"), maintained by
Alejandro Ojeda Gutiérrez ("Maintainer").

This Agreement is intended to protect both the Contributor and the Maintainer. It
does not change the Contributor's rights to use their own Contributions for any
other purpose.

## Definitions

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted
by the Contributor to the Project. This includes, but is not limited to, source
code, documentation, configuration files, and any related material.

**"Submitted"** means any form of communication sent to the Project, including
but not limited to pull requests, commits, issues, and comments on any
Project-managed communication channel, but excluding communications that are
conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the Contributor as
"Not a Contribution."

**"Contributor"** (also "You") means the individual who enters into this
Agreement with the Maintainer. This Agreement applies to individual Contributors
only. If You are making Contributions on behalf of a legal entity, please contact
the Maintainer.

## 1. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to:

(a) reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
and distribute Your Contributions and any derivative works thereof;

(b) sublicense the rights granted in Section 1(a) through multiple tiers of
sublicensees; and

(c) relicense Your Contributions, in whole or in part, under any license terms,
including but not limited to open source licenses, proprietary licenses, or
dual-licensing arrangements, at the Maintainer's sole discretion.

## 2. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the
Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contributions, where
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are
necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by the combination of Your
Contributions with the Project to which such Contributions were submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your
Contribution or the Project constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement
for that Contribution or Project shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.

## 3. Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that:

(a) You are the sole author of each Contribution and are legally entitled to
grant the licenses stated in this Agreement.

(b) Each Contribution is Your original creation. If any part of Your Contribution
includes materials from third parties, You will clearly identify those materials
and their applicable license terms at the time of submission.

(c) If You are employed and Your employer has rights to intellectual property that
You create, You represent that: (i) Your employer has authorized Your
Contributions on behalf of said employer, or (ii) Your employer has waived any
rights over Your Contributions, or (iii) Your Contributions do not fall within
the scope of Your employment.

(d) Your Contribution does not, to the best of Your knowledge, violate any third
party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

## 4. No Obligation to Use

The Maintainer is under no obligation to accept, include, or use any
Contribution. The decision to incorporate a Contribution remains at the sole
discretion of the Maintainer.

## 5. Disclaimer

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

## 6. Contributor Rights

Except for the licenses granted herein to the Maintainer, You reserve all right,
title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

## 7. Relicensing Transparency

The Maintainer commits to maintaining the Project under an open source or source
available license. If the Maintainer exercises the relicensing rights granted
under Section 1(c), the Maintainer will:

(a) Continue to make available a version of the Project under the European Union
Public License 1.2 (EUPL-1.2) or a compatible open source license as listed in
the EUPL-1.2 Appendix.

(b) Clearly communicate any relicensing decisions to the community through the
Project's public communication channels.

This Section 7 represents a voluntary commitment by the Maintainer and is not
intended to create enforceable obligations or to limit the rights granted in
Section 1.

## 8. Termination

(a) You may terminate this Agreement at any time by sending a written notice to
the Maintainer via email or through the Project's public issue tracker. The
termination shall become effective thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice by
the Maintainer.

(b) Upon the effective date of termination, this Agreement shall cease to apply to
any Contributions Submitted after such date. You will no longer be permitted to
Submit new Contributions to the Project unless You enter into a new agreement with
the Maintainer.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement shall have no
retroactive effect. All licenses granted under Sections 1 and 2 with respect to
Contributions Submitted prior to the effective date of termination shall survive
such termination and shall remain in full force and effect in perpetuity.
Sections 3, 5, 6, and 9 through 13 shall also survive any termination of this
Agreement.

## 9. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the European Union Member State in which the Maintainer has his seat, resides, or
has his registered office.

Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be submitted
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Maintainer resides
or exercises his principal activity.

## 10. Assignment

The Maintainer shall be entitled to assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits
or obligations under this Agreement on an unrestricted basis, including but not
limited to assignment to a legal entity created by the Maintainer to manage the
Project. Upon such assignment, all references to the Maintainer in this Agreement
shall be deemed to refer to the assignee.

## 11. Severability

If any term or condition of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or unenforceable,
the validity or enforceability of any other term or condition of this Agreement
shall not be affected. Such invalid or unenforceable term or condition shall be
enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law and, where necessary, completed by
a valid interpretation which to the extent possible achieves the original purpose
of the invalid or unenforceable term or condition.

## 12. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning
Contributions to the Project and supersedes all prior communications regarding
the subject matter hereof.

## 13. Acceptance

and understood this Agreement. You indicate Your acceptance by commenting on a
pull request with the following statement:
